# GDAgent
### The Professional AI Development Environment for Godot

GDAgent transforms the Godot Editor into a fully integrated AI coding environment. Unlike simple chat plugins, GDAgent provides a persistent, workspace-aware terminal engineered for AI-assisted development inside the editor.

## Key Features

### 🪄 Smart Onboarding Wizard
Getting started with AI tools can be complex. GDAgent's **First Run Wizard** automatically scans your system for installed AI CLI tools (Claude, Gemini, Aider, GitHub Copilot, Mistral, Codex, OpenCode) and configures them for instant use. If a tool is missing, the wizard provides direct installation commands and documentation links.

### 🖥️ Professional Workspace Layouts
Design your perfect AI workflow with flexible layout options:
- **Split View**: Run two agents side-by-side (e.g., one for coding, one for debugging).
- **Grid View**: Manage multiple sessions with a visual card-based overview.
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitively reorganize tabs and split panes to suit your needs.
- **Distraction-Free Mode**: Maximize the terminal to focus entirely on the conversation.

### 💾 Persistent Sessions
Work shouldn't be lost when you close the editor.
- **Auto-Save**: All active sessions, tabs, and layout configurations are persisted automatically.
- **Customization**: Rename sessions and assign custom icons (or smart letter avatars) to organize tasks by feature or bug.
- **Context Awareness**: Sessions track their own working directories and environment variables.

### 📚 Integrated Prompt Library
Stop typing the same boilerplate context. The built-in **Template Library** allows you to quickly inject context-aware prompts for common tasks:
- **Debugging**: Automatically format error inquiries.
- **Refactoring**: Standardized code improvement requests.
- **Documentation**: Generation templates for GDScript docs.

## Supported Agents

GDAgent provides first-class support and auto-detection for popular AI CLI tools including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, GitHub Copilot CLI, Mistral, OpenAI Codex, and OpenCode.
